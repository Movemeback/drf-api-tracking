DRF API Sample
==============
A simple playground for messing around with REST APIs and for testing drf-api-tracking

1) create venv: `python3 -m venv ~/venv/drf_sample`
2) enable venv: `source ~/venv/drf_sample/bin/activate`
3) install pip/pipenv: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip pipenv`
4) `pipenv install`

5) create db:
`python manage.py migrate`
6) create admin account
`python manage.py createsuperuser`

7) drf_yasg / swagger ui has been included as part of this sample, so you can execute REST api calls via:
`python manage.py runserver localhost:8000/swagger`

8) check in admin view that the log has been added after call to your REST api:
`http://localhost:8000/admin/rest_framework_tracking/`

Development:
------
To install drf_api_tracking for development use:

`pipenv install -e ../../drf-api-tracking`

Note this is already configured in the Pipfile


If you then make changes to the models in the drf-api-tracking library, then make sure you run:
`python manage.py makemigrations`
and ensure that the migrations file(s) are checked into git and PR made.
